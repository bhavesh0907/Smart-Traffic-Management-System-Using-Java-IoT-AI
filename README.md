# Smart Traffic Management System

## Overview
The **Smart Traffic Management System** utilizes AI and IoT to analyze real-time traffic conditions and optimize signal timings. It improves traffic flow efficiency by processing sensor data and dynamically adjusting traffic signals. 🚦🤖

## Features
- 📡 **Real-Time Traffic Analysis** – Uses sensors and cameras to monitor traffic conditions.
- 🚦 **Dynamic Signal Control** – Adjusts traffic lights based on congestion patterns.
- 🌍 **IoT Integration** – Connects with smart city infrastructure for seamless operations.
- 🔍 **AI-Based Prediction** – Forecasts traffic trends using machine learning.
- 📊 **Data Visualization** – Displays traffic insights through an interactive dashboard.
